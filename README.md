# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction

This machine learning project predicts a student's **Math score** based on various features such as gender, parental education, lunch type, reading & writing scores, and more. The goal is to demonstrate how regression models can be used to identify patterns in academic performance data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dataset contains student information and exam results. This project explores how different demographic and educational factors influence a student’s math performance. A Flask web interface allows users to input data and get predictions in real time.

## 🧠 Features Used

- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

## 📊 Models Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor

Each model is trained and evaluated using `R² Score`, and the best model is selected automatically based on performance.
